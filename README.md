# MAD Dictionary

Is this dictionary mad? Well yes, but actually no. MAD = Modern Android Development, this app is built using the very new and very awesome frameworks
in the Android SDK like Coroutine, View/DataBinding, MVVM architecture, RecyclerView etc.

## Brief info about this project:

This app displays meanings of words using a free [Dicionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). This app makes network calls asynchronously using Coroutines
and Retrofit and with the help of Moshi, the JSON is parsed into Kotlin objects with ease!! This app uses MVVM app architecture and displays the results in 
a nested RecyclerView. (I had to do the nesting due to the complex nature of JSON response). Also, this app uses ViewBinding to eleminate findViewById() :D

This app might be lagging behind in some aspects so please feel free to contribute to this project.

## Upcoming features

* Listen pronunciation in voice
